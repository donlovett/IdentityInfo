# IdentityInfo

This is a series of pages where I will write down and share some learnings on Identity.

Identity for inside an organization

Also Identity for external relationships with people, other organizations, and even things such as IoT devices

The identify world has a lot to keep track of and is basically a provider to the parties in interactions such as the transactions for a purchase.  These interactions have been roughly divided into Customer Relationships and Supply Chain Relationships.  

The ability to separate identities into ones that can be correlated with other identity date and public, private, and anonymous or unknown is critical to privacy protection.

The other key concepts include trust, claims and verifiers.
More on this later
